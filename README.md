# List Pagination and Filtering

This is an [application](https://luqp.github.io/List-Pagination-and-Filtering-v1/) that is designed entirely in "Vanilla" JavaScript to make a pagination of Lists
in HTML format and data filtering in real time as the user types

## Pagination:

Pagination helps separate the data into pages to facilitate navigation,
this program is flexible and allows you to change the amount of items you want to display in the pages
and choose the paging number where you want to start displaying the list.

## Search and Filtering: 

Search allows you to enter the name you are looking for, and with some functions and the event `keyup`
improves the user experience by making the list filtered in real time as the user types.
